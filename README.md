# Embedded-BLDC-Controller

**Microcontroller PCB to drive an Hyperion BLDC motor controller from an analogue input voltage**

The schematic is currently setup to drive from a 12 V power source and 12 V input range. The drive voltage divider (R3 and R4) needs to be changed to scale any input range to 0 to 3.5 V.

The drive input and output pins are designated with "Drive" and "PWM" respectively.
